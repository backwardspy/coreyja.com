Description: Join seasoned software developer, Coreyja, in this immersive coding live stream recorded on December 7, 2022. See how Corey tackles Day 4 of the renowned Advent of Code Challenge using Rust! In this video, the challenge revolves around helping elves organize their assigned camp sections.

Corey makes the complex simple as he elucidates the problem and walks through an example input. Watch as he masterfully codes a solution to the problem, parsing the input, implementing a pair struct, and writing methods to check for overlaps and containment. You'll get to see live as he runs test cases using both example inputs and his own inputs, all of which pass successfully.

If you're ready to level up your Rust coding skills or just interested in watching how a pro tackles these challenges, this video is a must-watch. Don't just hear about it, experience it - Because you never know when you might be asked to help some elves organize a camp!
