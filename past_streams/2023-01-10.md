Join Corey in this engaging live stream recorded on January 10, 2023, where he shares the progress and inner workings of a unique project â€” simulating falling sand in a cave using Rust. The video provides insight into the challenges faced in part one and two of the project which involves stacking, processing, and counting units of sand, and how Rust helps to achieve the desired results. Learn about the strategies implemented for code optimization, including profiling and hashing, along with Corey's reflections on the performance improvements they deliver. The video ends with the satisfaction of successfully solving part two of the problem and anticipation for the continuation of the project. Whether you're interested in Rust, coding, or simply curious about this inventive project, buckle up for an educational ride! Don't miss out on these insightful programming experiences.
