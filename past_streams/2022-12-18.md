Join Coreyja in an immersive, problem-solving Rust coding session recorded on December 18, 2022. In this episode, Corey becomes a master navigator as he attempts to find the shortest path through a peculiar maze with varying elevations. Witness how he troubleshoots his A\* algorithm implementation, adds debugging statements, and painstakingly analyzes generated paths. Learning is oftentimes born from confusion and challenge; this live stream covers it all. Plenty of bloopers, head-scratching moments, and practical Rust programming insights! If you're up for a coding challenge or just love seeing someone make sense of complex algorithms, this one's for you!
