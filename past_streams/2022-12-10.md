Description: 

Join Coreyja in this recorded live stream from December 10th, 2022, where he dives deep into his unique coding project, "Treehouse". Utilizing the power of Rust, Corey navigates through a forest of complex calculations and parsing techniques, translating a grid of trees by their heights and understanding the concept of scenic scores. 

From implementing robust calculation methods, identifying errors, and running intensive tests to debugging to perfection, the Treehouse project is a prime example of advanced Rust programming in action. 

The highlight? Corey successfully develops part two of the project - finding the highest possible scenic score in a grid, reflecting his profound understanding of the subject. 

Don't miss this unique opportunity to watch an expert decipher the nuances of Rust programming and cultivate new techniques. Stay tuned for Day Nine of the Advent of Code challenge!
