Description: 
Watch as host Corey, also known as coreyja online, builds a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch using Rust. This coding session, streamed live on December 5th, 2022, is part of the Advent of Code challenge. In this video, Corey sets up a new crate and parses game input to determine round-by-round scores based on the player's moves. 

This session presents a two-part challenge - firstly, to calculate player scores based on round outcomes (win, lose, or draw), and secondly, to determine the optimum move for a specific outcome. Corey not only creates, but also validates the functions necessary to solve these challenges, leading to the correct total scores for both parts of the challenge.

Don't miss out on this insightful coding tutorial. Whether you're a rookie coder learning Rust or a seasoned pro looking for a fun challenge, this video has something for everyone. Dive in now!
