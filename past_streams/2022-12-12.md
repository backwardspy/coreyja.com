Description:

Join Corey as he embarks on a unique coding adventure with Rust in this live stream recording from December 12, 2022. In this session, Corey works on simulating a cathode ray tube, which involves parsing input commands, calculating signal strength, and simulating CRT pixel rendering with a novel Rust library called "cathode-ray-tube". 

Corey meticulously guides you through his process, explaining the code structure, debugging process and the intricate logic that goes into this fascinating task. Whether you're a seasoned Rust developer or someone looking to catch a glimpse into the world of programming with Rust, this live coding session offers valuable insights and techniques that you will surely find useful.

Dive into CRS's pixel drawing process, explore the connection between CPU instructions and CRT drawing operations, and witness how Corey refactors code and troubleshoots challenges. Concluding with a successful printout of certain characters based on the pixels on the CRT screen, this live stream is a must-watch for every tech enthusiast.
