Description:

Join Corey as he dives into a real-time simulation of falling sand through cave networks using Rust. Recorded on January 9, 2023, this livestream demonstrates the development of the "Regoth Reservoir" project. Watch as he parses complex input into coordinates, lays out the rock structures inside the cave and defines the frames of the simulation. Experience each turn of the simulation, understanding the logic behind the movement of sand particles and how to detect when they reach a stable state. Also, get insights into the ingenious method of calculating the number of sand particles that rest before plunging into the abyss! Hit play to watch Coreyâ€™s testing and validation process that ultimately leads to a successful solution. Dive in to enhance your coding skills in Rust!
