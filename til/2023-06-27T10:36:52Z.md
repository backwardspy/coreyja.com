title: Cleaning up unused Typescript Files with `ts-prune`

TLDR: `npx ts-prune` will find us-used files in your Typescript project!

Recently at work I had some extra time on Friday. Not enough that I wanted to
start a big task, but enough time to do some cleanup.

I found [`ts-prune`](https://github.com/nadeesha/ts-prune) which looks through a
TypeScript project and finds things that are unused. It helped me find things
that were completely unused and could be cleaned up, and some types there were being
exported from their file but didn't need to be!

`ts-prune` is in maintenance mode, but I found it to work well for my usecase!

One caveat is that it just prints the files with errors to stdout, I had to go
fix the issues manually. But well worth it for a more cleaned up repo!
